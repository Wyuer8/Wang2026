# QBO Analysis Code

This repository contains analysis code used to study the characteristics and dynamics of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO).

The scripts support the calculation of key QBO metrics and the diagnosis of QBO evolution.

---

## Scope

The code is organized around two main components:

1. **QBO characteristics**
   - Identification of QBO phases
   - Calculation of QBO amplitude and period
   - Analysis of vertical structure and phase–height evolution

2. **QBO dynamics**
   - Momentum budget diagnostics

---

## Usage notes

- The scripts are intended for research use and are designed for atmospheric reanalysis or model output in standard formats.
- Users may need to adapt file paths, variable names, and level definitions to their own datasets.
- The code illustrates analysis workflows rather than providing a fully automated pipeline.

## Code availability

The code is provided to support transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.
